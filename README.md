# Cool stuff

...about perception, cognition, neuroscience, psychology, physics, mathematics and whatever else I find cool and interesting.

This is a personal, curated list of links to stuff that I find interesting and relevant to my scientific work on auditory perception. If you have anything to add to this list for whatever reason, you're more than welcome to do a pull request. The point of this list is for me to have one place for all links to cool stuff that I come about (might as well share it with the world, right?).


## Roger Penrose, consciousness, limits of computation and quantum mechanics

**An [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orMtwOz6Db0) with Penrose by Lex Fridman.**

- He discusses the [Gödel's theorems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gödel%27s_incompleteness_theorems) as setting limits of what kinds of faculties may be performed by computation. Based on this, he doesn't believe consciousness is a product of computation. It may arise from quantum processes in neurons, like those associated with [microtubules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtubule) (I'm personally totally unconvinced by this bit). 
- Alfred Tarski followed Gödel with [Tarski's undefinability theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarski%27s_undefinability_theorem) that states that _arithmetical truth cannot be defined in arithmetic_. Crazy, right? Tarski was a member of [Lwów-Warsaw school](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lwów–Warsaw_school) school BTW. 
- There is a very profound statement about his general philosophy. He can be called a materialist but he has no idea what _material_ is. This is an repeating theme in the entire conversation - although people make these distinctions between mental and physical, nobody is really sure what is the physical world and we're only scratching the surface.
- One example is that quantum mechanics may be incomplete, especially the [wave function collapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function_collapse) bit is problematic.
- A crazy idea which is a viable interpretation of quantum mechanics is the [consciousness causes collapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann–Wigner_interpretation) interpretation, where consciousness is something that makes the quantum states determined (the [quantum measurement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement_in_quantum_mechanics)). I hope I got that one right.
- The craziest thing is that if this is true, the [Schrödinger's cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schrödinger%27s_cat) is dead or alive depending on the consciousness of the person who's looking. Sick.
- So, all in all, Penrose's view is that **because consciousness is not a computational process, it perhaps is permeated by some sort of a non-[Turing-machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine) thingy in the brain**.
